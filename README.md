OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a standard specification defining a crosslanguage, cross-platform API for writing applications that produce 2D and 3D computer 
graphics. 
2.2 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
● Programming language – C/C++ using OpenGL 
● Operating system – Windows 8.1 Pro 
● Compiler/IDE - Code::Blocks IDE 
● Graphics library – GL/glut.h ● OpenGL 2.0. 
2.3FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
OpenGL APIs: 
If we want to have a control on the flow of program and if we want to interact with the 
window system then we use OpenGL API’S. Vertices are represented in the same manner 
internally, whether they are specified as two-dimensional or three-dimensional entities, 
everything that we do are here will be equally valid in three dimensions. Although OpenGL 
is easy to learn, compared with other APIs, it is nevertheless powerful. It supports the simple 
three dimensional programs and also supports the advanced rendering techniques.
